# tictactoe
A commandline tic-tac-toe game for idle fun.

## To play
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/thisisdhaas/tictactoe.git`
2. `cd tictactoe`
3. `python tictactoe.py`
4. Enjoy!

## Details
There are 4 computer AIs to play against, each with varying degrees of frustrating stupidity:
1. `Random`, which plays a random move each time.
2. `Defensive`, which plays randomly but blocks threats when it is about to lose.
3. `Offensive`, which plays like Defensive but will always play a winning move if one is available.
4. `Optimal`, which builds the full minimax tree for the game of Tic Tac Toe and WINS!

## Why did I do this?
I don't know. But I put an Apache License in here because it felt alarmingly satisfying to do so.
